This is a file to test fetch and merge operations.

Created this file on the remote repo without having any it in the local repo. If the local repo is behind the remote repo, it will give you an error when you are pushing any change from local to remote.

Will test this with pushing a file called push_test.txt from the local repo to remote.

For this you need to:

Step 1: git fetch origin
(This gets or fetches all the changes made to the online/remote repo.)

Step 2: git merge origin YOUR_BRANCH_NAME
( This merges updates made online with your local copy.)
